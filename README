		    PlDOc --- SWI-Prolog source documentation

Author: Jan Wiemaker

Status
------

Approach has been discussed with two external Prolog developers.

Code is very imcomplete.  Development plan:

---++ SWI-Prolog hooks

Have been realised in CVS version as of Jul 30, 2006

---++ Wiki processor

Making solid progress.  remaining issues:

	* Tables in lists
	* Paragraphs in list-items
	* Code/verbatim environments
	* Testing

---++ Mode language

Now uses Prolog parser. Should we change  this to define our own syntax?
More flexible, but a lot of work and   Prolog syntax is clear. Must deal
with multi-line types/modes.
