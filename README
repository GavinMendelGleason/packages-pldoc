		    PlDOc --- SWI-Prolog source documentation

Author: Jan Wiemaker

Status
------

Approach has been discussed with two external Prolog developers.

Code is very imcomplete.  Development plan:

---++ SWI-Prolog hooks

Have been realised in CVS version as of Jul 30, 2006

---++ Wiki processor

Making solid progress.  remaining issues:

	* Tables in lists
	* Paragraphs in list-items
	* Complete tag processing
		- Combining multiple tags

---++ HTML generation

	* Generate structure for the file/module
		- Use module declaration
		- Provide access to filename
		- Use info from loaded system?  XREF?

---++ After Compilation with library(pldoc) loaded:

	* pldoc_comment(PredInd, -Modes, -Comment).
	  pldoc_comment(module(Module), -Comment).
	  ...

	  Comment = string

	* Can be combined with XREF info and/or normal meta-info
	
	* Gathering can also be hooked into XREF by loading pldoc
	  and xref.

---++ Summary extraction

	* Extract first sentence from description	

---++ Source processing

	* Synchronise source processing between
		- XREF
		- PceEmacs
		- PlDoc
