Author: Jan Wiemaker

Status
------

Approach has been discussed with two external Prolog developers.

Code is very imcomplete.  Development plan:

---++ SWI-Prolog hooks

Have been realised in CVS version as of Jul 30, 2006

---++ Wiki processor

Making solid progress.  remaining issues:

	* Tables in lists
	* Paragraphs in list-items
	* Testing

---++ Attributes (@throws, etc.)

	* To be defined and implemented

---++ Mode language

Uses Prolog parser using pldoc_modes module for the operators.

	* Multiple declarations must be separated by '.'
