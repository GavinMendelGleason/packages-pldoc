Approach has been discussed with two external Prolog developers.

Code is very imcomplete.  Development plan:

---++ SWI-Prolog hooks

Have been realised in CVS version as of Jul 30, 2006

---++ Wiki processor

Making solid progress.  remaining issues:

	* Tables in lists
	* Paragraphs in list-items
	* Complete tag processing
	* Testing

---++ HTML generation

	* Generate structure for the file/module
	* Generate mode declarations
	* Generate predicate body
	* CSS definitions

---++ Mode language

Uses Prolog parser using pldoc_modes module for the operators.

	* Multiple declarations must be separated by '.'
